You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message
The `load_in_4bit` and `load_in_8bit` arguments are deprecated and will be removed in the future versions. Please, pass a `BitsAndBytesConfig` object in `quantization_config` argument instead.

Money from your pocket goes to the stock market where you buy stocks. The stocks
you buy represent ownership in a business. When you buy stocks, you are 
essentially lending money to the business. The business uses the money to grow 
and operate. When the business does well and makes profits, the value of your 
stocks go up. When you sell your stocks, you get the money back, plus any 
profits made from the increase in stock value.

Happy Women's Day!

We celebrate you today,
A strong, smart, and brave girl.
You light up the world,
With your kindness and your heart.

You're a scientist, a doctor,
A teacher, a leader, a clown.
You're a superhero, a princess,
A ballerina, a rock star, a genius.

You're fierce, you're bold,
You're brave, you're bold.
You're a true friend,
A loyal companion, a true confidante.

So here's to you,
On this special day,
For all that you do,
And all that you are.

Happy Women's Day!
