You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message
The `load_in_4bit` and `load_in_8bit` arguments are deprecated and will be removed in the future versions. Please, pass a `BitsAndBytesConfig` object in `quantization_config` argument instead.

Money from your pocket goes to the stock market where you buy stocks. The stocks
you buy represent ownership in a business. When you buy stocks, you are 
essentially lending money to the business. The business uses the money to run 
its operations and hopefully make a profit. If the business does well, the value
of your stocks may go up, and you can sell them for a higher price than what you
paid for them. This way, you can make a profit from the money you originally 
lent to the business.

Here's a poem for Women's Day:

A woman is strong and kind,
With skills and talents to be found.
She can build and fix,
Or create and design,
With a heart full of love and a mind that's sharp.

She's a leader and a friend,
A helper and a confidante,
She's a mom and a wife,
A daughter, a sister, a wife.

So let's celebrate Women's Day,
With love and appreciation,
For all the amazing things,
That women do each and every day.

La chirurgie dentaire est une spécialité médicale qui s'intéresse aux dents, aux
gencives et à la bouche. Elle comprend l'étude, le diagnostic, la prévention, la
gestion et le traitement des maladies, des troubles et des affections des dents,
des gencives et de la bouche, qui sont généralement liés à la formation et à 
l'organisation des dents. La chirurgie dentaire peut également couvrir d'autres 
aspects du complexe crânio-faciaux, notamment le joint temporomandibulaire. Le 
praticien est appelé chirurgien-dentiste.
