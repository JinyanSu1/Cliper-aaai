You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message
The `load_in_4bit` and `load_in_8bit` arguments are deprecated and will be removed in the future versions. Please, pass a `BitsAndBytesConfig` object in `quantization_config` argument instead.

Money from your pocket goes to the stock market where you buy stocks. The stocks
you buy represent ownership in a business. When you buy stocks, you are 
essentially lending money to the business. The business uses the money to run 
its operations and hopefully make a profit. If the business does well, the value
of your stocks may go up, and you can sell them for a higher price than what you
paid for them. This way, you can make a profit from the money you originally 
lent to the business.

Here's a poem for Women's Day:

A woman is strong and kind,
With skills and talents to be found.
She can build and fix,
Or create and design,
With a heart full of love and a mind that's sharp.

She's a leader and a friend,
A helper and a confidante,
She's a mom and a wife,
A daughter, a sister, a wife.

So let's celebrate Women's Day,
With love and appreciation,
For all the amazing things,
That women do each and every day.
